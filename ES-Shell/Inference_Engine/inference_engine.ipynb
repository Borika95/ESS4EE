    "\n",
    "Membership functions define the degree of membership of a variable in a fuzzy set, transforming crisp input values into fuzzy values that can be processed by the inference engine. Typically, they use shapes like triangular, trapezoidal, or Gaussian to represent fuzzy sets. Defining and adjusting these functions is crucial for the system to perform fuzzy logic operations, mapping input variables to fuzzy sets. They are implemented in the [FIS.py](../Inference_Engine/FIS.py) file."

    "\n",
    "The inference mechanism is responsible for processing fuzzy inputs and applying rules to generate fuzzy outputs. It uses fuzzy rules, typically in the form of \"If-Then\" statements, to make decisions. This process involves fuzzification, rule evaluation, and defuzzification.\n",

    "Here, you can specify the logic of the inference mechanism, including how it evaluates rules and how fuzzy outputs are converted back to crisp values. This component is essential for translating fuzzy logic into actionable results. It is part of the [FIS.py](../Inference_Engine/FIS.py) file."

    "The fuzzy rule base consists of a set of fuzzy rules that guide the reasoning process in the system. These rules typically follow an \"If-Then\" format. The rule base determines how the inputs (processed through membership functions) are combined to produce outputs, influencing the decision-making process.\n",
